# Vegetable price prediction
A model that predicts price changes for agricultural products affected by the weather, including cabbage.
It was assumed that variables such as average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation affect the price of cabbage.

## Skills
- **Pandas**: Increased readability by converting Excel files to CSV files, then effectively loaded the CSV files using Pandas and utilized NumPy to transform the data into an array format suitable for the model.
- **TensorFlow, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn**: Created a multiple linear regression model to predict cabbage prices based on categorical variables using TensorFlow. Set up the cost function and optimization function, and performed model training by creating a TensorFlow session.

## Dataset
You can find it on the Meteorological Data Open Portal.
For the price of cabbage, data was extracted from sites such as agricultural product distribution information.

## Requirements
- tensorflow
- pytorch (torch, torchvision)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
